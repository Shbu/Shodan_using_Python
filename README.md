Shodan_using_Python
===================

Accessing Shodan  (Scariest Search Engine) using Python Library.

Description about Shodan:
-------------------------------
Shodan is a search engine that lets you find specific types of computers (routers, servers, etc.) that are connected to internet using a variety of filters. By using Shodan, users can view different smart devices connected to internet at any moment. Things may include routers, fridges, smart phones, cameras etc. Scariest part of search results is that users can see smart devices that are open(without any authentication) and access them through the provided IP address. Some have also described it as a search engine of service banners, which are meta-data the server sends back to the client.

Project:
------------------
This project deals in developing Automated Python programs which can help access Shodan Search Engine with customized search strings. Main purpose is to make things automatic, such as getting search results and saving to documents, looping them back to search engine for more details etc. In this process we have used Python Programming Language, associated libraries and Shodan API Libraries.
